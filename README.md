# Pairwise AHP form
The pairwise AHP form was a tool developed for a project under my M.Sc. program. The Jupyter Notebook can be used as a form, which then can be filled 
with the choices of stakeholders on various policy alternatives. The script will then process the information submitted and calculate the consistency of
the choices made across all questions. If the consistency fall below a certain treshold it recommend that the user make changes to their answer.

To start the binder, which will set up the environment and build the form, use the following:
